Page 2
The R7 District regulations allow for General ojjice and several other specific use types to be integrated
into predominately residenual development. The proposed Phase Two and Three of the developm_ent
do not compl_y with the R7 District.
Applicauons for PUD’s need to be submitted incompliance with Secuon 55-589 of the Omaha
Municipal Code. Site, landscaping, grading, utility, circulauon and public services plans and
architectural elevauons are required, as well as development schedules, land use plans and traffic
impact analysis (if required) are to be submitted. Photographs with narrauve informauon do not
qualify as architectural plans and elevauons.
No Building Permit will be issued based on a site plan that does not comply with the provisions
of the Zoning Ordinance. Approval of a rezoning by the Planning Board and Cigy Council does
not include or imply an acceptance of the site plan for permitppgposes. _
SPECIAL INFORMATION
Site Characteristics: The site includes just over 25 acres of landthatrises slightly from the northeast
corner (1,184 m.s.l) near the southwest corner (1,200 m.s.l) but then rises sharply corner to 99th Street
and Military Road. The land is currently vacant and used agriculturally. North 99”“ Street abuts the
site on the west for its length.
Development Proposal: The applicant proposes a four phase development.
Phase One (2013 - 2015) will include a Religious assembly, religious educauon classrooms,
administrauon and counseling, Day care (general), gymnasium, sports fields and amphitheater and
surface parking.

the opposite side of 99th Street.
0 Sidewalks - SidewaIl<s are proposed adjacent to 99*1“ Street.- Other sidewalks that allowfor
interior and perimeter circuladon need to be provided.
Grading and Drainage: The project requires a Post Construcuon Storm Water Management Plan that
demonstrates control of the first 1/2 inch of storm water runoff on site and no net increase in storm
water runoff from a 2-year storm event. `

Recommendation Report
Case #C10-11-099, C11-11-100
Page 3
Financing: The proposed development of the site will be funded privately.
Land Use and Planning: The PUD, as proposed, does not comply with the base R7 Disuict
regulations and therefore is not in conformance with the Master Plan.
A development plan in compliance with the R7 Disuict regulations that includes Religious assembly,
Primary educational facilities, and Multiple family residential uses could be approved for this site.
A Mixed Use Disuict development plan, _which includes office and commercial uses as well as the
other proposed uses and an expanded area including land north and east of this site adjacent to Ida
Street and Blair High Road with rezoning to MU could also be considered.
ANALYSIS:
The applicant needs to amend their development plans and proposed uses to comply withthe R7
Disuict that has been requested; including proper subdivision of the site or revise the rezoning
request, expand their development proposal to include lands to the north and east, and properly
subdivide the site for development of a Mixed Use District. Either way an updated Uaffic study and
a sheet connection through the site have been requested which may result in further amendments to
any-proposed site plans.
RECOMMENDATION: Lay over the request to allow additional time for the applicant to meet with
the Planning Department to discuss potential development alternatives for the site.

PLANNING BOARD MINUTES
C10-11-O99 REQUEST: Rezoning from Ll to R7 and approval of a
C11-11-100 PUD-Planned Unit Development Overlay
Eagles Nest District
(Laid Over from 6/1/11) LOCATION: East of 99th Street, South of Redick Avenue
Doug Halvorson, Olsson Associates, 2211 South 67"‘ Street, appeared before the board on
behalf of the applicant. Mr. Halvorson stated the proposed Eagles Nest Worship Center is
relocating from the Sorensen Parkway area with the new location consisting of 25 acres. The
church is expanding tremendously with a vision for a new Worship Center which will be Phase I.
Phase ll will be a gymnasium, elementary school with a connected_asslsted living facility and a
sports field. The proposed location is ideal due to the visibility and the access to the interstate.
Mr. Halvorson indicated that he agrees with most of the comments and will continue to work with
the Planning Department and Public Works. The most difficult issue wlll be the request for an
easement that connects to Wal-Mart. Mr. Halvorson offered to answer any questions.
Chad Weaver, Assistant Planning Director, Planning Department, confirmed the need for an
access easement from the north property line (between Lots 5 and 6) that extends to the 99"‘
Street access. He stated that according to Public Works the access is useful and necessary and
there needs to be more common access provided especially as the ground to the east develops.
Mr. Weaver stated that the department recommends approval subject to the four items listed on
the recommendation report.
Mr. Neary questioned if there is a shortage of industrial zoned ground and lf this ls an appropriate
use for industrial zoned ground according to the Master Plan. Mr. Weaver answered that the
intersection allows for this type of use on the underlying industrial Master Plan. In this case, with
the presence of Wal-Mart there will most likely not be any industrial users.
Mr. Neary asked if the ground has been purchased and is the financing in place for the project.
Pastor James Hart, 16 Marina Court, Carter Lake, Iowa, answered that the land has not yet been
purchased but is contingent upon all of the approvals but the financing is in place.
Lillie Knudsen, 9812 Military Road, appeared before the board in opposition. Ms. Knudsen
questioned why the church would need so many acres and why the church is moving. Mr. Hart
answered that the present location is being leased and is not available for purchase. He
indicated that the church has outgrown its present facility with a total of 1,200 parishioners. Mr.
Hart stated the ultimate plan is to build a gymnasium, community center, elementary school and
senior living facility with adequate parking.
Mr. Kelley moved to APPROVE. Approval of the rezoning from Ll to R7; approval of the PUD
subject to: 1) Submittal of an acceptable modified traffic study and development agreement
providing for all required improvements prior to forwardingthe request to City Council for final
action; 2) All site/landscape plans and building elevations being amended to comply with all
applicable regulations prior to being forwarded to City Council for final action; 3) Submitting a
revised phasing schedule that eliminates references to items that do not comply with all
applicable regulations; and 4) The public access easement from the north property line (between
Lot 5 and 6) needs to be extended so that it connects to the driveway on the west side of the
development. Mr. Rosenbaum seconded the motion which carried 7-O.
